I've been a faculty member in the [Geography Department](https://geography.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the UW-Madison since 2003, and most of my research since then has been funded by [National Science Foundation grants](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?PIId=&PIFirstName=Joseph&PILastName=Mason&IncludeCoPI=true&PIOrganization=&PIState=&PIZip=&PICountry=&ProgOrganization=&ProgEleCode=&BooleanElement=All&ProgRefCode=&BooleanRef=All&Program=&ProgOfficer=&Keyword=&AwardNumberOperator=&AwardAmount=&AwardInstrument=&ActiveAwards=true&ExpiredAwards=true&OriginalAwardDateOperator=&StartDateOperator=&ExpDateOperator=){:target="_blank"}. From 1997 to 2003, I was a faculty member at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in the [Conservation and Survey Division](http://snr.unl.edu/csd/){:target="_blank"} (the state geological, water, and soil survey) and the [Department of Geoscience](https://eas.unl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Part of my job there was Quaternary geologic mapping, including numerous 7.5-minute quadrangles in the Omaha-Lincoln area, available [here](http://snr.unl.edu/data/geologysoils/STATEMAP/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} from CSD. I've also collaborated extensively with colleagues at the [School of Geographic and Oceanographic Sciences](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/7f/4d/c7136a163661/page.htm){:target="_blank"} at Nanjing University, and taught a short course on Processes of the Critical Zone there in 2018.
