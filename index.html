            <h4>Research and Teaching:</h4>
              <p>With my students and collaborators, I study loess (windblown dust), sand dunes, and soils, to understand how landscapes of the Great Plains, the Midwestern US, and northern China have evolved and responded to past environmental change. By understanding how landscapes and soils have changed in the past, and the processes involved, we can understand and predict their present and future response to rapidly changing climate and human impacts. Our methods include extensive field research, lab investigations of soil and sediment properties, GIS and remote sensing techiniques, and numerical modeling. I teach courses on these and other topics in the <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>).</p>
